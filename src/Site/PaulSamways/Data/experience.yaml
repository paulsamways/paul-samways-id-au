            Nyggle was developed in collaboration with an ex-colleague to explore the area of customer
            satisfaction for small-medium retail businesses. Nyggle aims to be the online version of
            a 'suggestion box', where customers can discreetly and anonymously provide feedback
            to business owners when product or services do not meet their expectations.

            The product presents to consumers as a mobile-first web application, written in React + ASP.NET, 
            focusing on providing a quick and easy mechanism to submit feedback. Consumers can locate a business
            by scanning QR codes located on physical displays, or by using the search functionality of the site.
            PostgreSQL's FTS, and the PostGIS extension was used to provide quick, location aware, searching
            of the OpenStreetMap data to locate businesses.

            Dashboards, reporting and alerts are available to business owners to view feedback, and to
            provide insights into their customer's satisfaction.

            Nyggle is currently in the early stage of testing.

      - name: Alerting
        description: |
            The objective of the Alerting project was to deliver a system which could detect financial
            crime within Australia's domestic financial system, without requiring reporting entities to submit
            all domestic transaction information to AUSTRAC.

            The platform was built as a distributed computation system which allowed the analysis of
            complex transaction graphs, where the connections between the accounts were
            homomorphically encrypted, preventing the disclosure of any information which a node
            does not already have.

            This project involved close collaboration with experts in mathematics and cryptography to 
            build a proof of concept/MVP to demonstrate capability and viability. The system used an 
            embedded DSL written in Python to coordinate the workload out to the individual 
            nodes which were written in Go. Go was chosen due to it's performance characteristics, 
            and ability to interop effortlessly with C++/CUDA libraries.

            I was involved in the project from the very start of the engineering effort, and was responsible
            for the design and development of the compute nodes.

  projects:
      - name: Regulation as a Platform (RaaP)
        url: https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/Future-Cities/Optimising-service-delivery/RaaP
        description: |
            Regulation as a Platform (RaaP) ran as a collaboration between the Dept. of Industry and CSIRO Data61
            in the [NISA: Platforms for Open Data](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-innovation-and-science-agenda-report)
            program. Building upon the research conducted by the legal informatics team within Data61, 
            we created a platform to encode parts of Australia's legislation as sets of digital logic rules, 
            and proof of concept applications to demonstrate utility.

            The platform consisted of multiple back-end services written in Haskell, Scala or Python and
            deployed into a Kubernetes cluster running on the Google Cloud infrastructure. The platform's rule
            authoring application was written in TypeScript using Mithril.js and designed as a single-page
            application.
      - name: ACTive Community

        description: |
            ACTive Community was a program run by the University of Canberra to investigate the activity levels
            of Canberrans through fitness tracking devices. I was the principal engineer and designed the system 
            used to register participant devices and collect data over the study period.

            The system required a web front-end, written as a single-page application using the Mithril.js
            library, which enabled participants to join the study and connect their Fitbit or Garmin fitness
            devices.

            Once a device was connected, we were able to retrieve the participant's activity history and then poll
            each day for new fitness data. The RESTful API and background polling mechanism was written in Haskell
            and deployed alongside a PostgreSQL database.

            The project was considered a great success with over 1000 participants registered and contributing
            data, with no downtime or known defects in the system.

      - name: Certification Management System
        description: |
            As part of a broader project to move an industry certification scheme to ABCB, we were
            required to take ownership of an existing software solution which was used by industry
            to manage certificates and product catalogues.

            When we received the software, we assessed it for suitability in our environment and found
            that it was unsuitable due to a considerable number of security issues. These issues
            included vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, broken authentication/credential management, and
            a design which allowed the client (browser) to access data in an uncontrolled way.

            I rewrote/refactored the system as a new ASP.NET application, maintaining all the existing features,
            and was able to have it deployed within the original project timelines.
             

      - name: XML Publishing System
        description: |
            Part of the ABCB's responsibilities is to produce the national construction and building codes.
            These codes were published, at the time, as a set of printed technical books which were authored
            in-house by the technical team. Management and ownership of the software platform was handled by
            our team.

            By the time I had joined the organisation it had been almost ten years since the system had been deployed
            and was starting to show its age. There were many bugs and issues which had arisen and, while it
            was possible to work around them, it caused significant friction between the teams. I volunteered
            to spend time understanding how the various components fit together, and resolve as many of the issues
            as I could. I was able to resolve all the known issues and produced documentation to support
            maintenance in the future.

            The authoring platform consisted of many individual commerical and open source applications,
            integrated together using a combination of Java, JavaScript, .NET and XML/XSLT processors.

      - name: FinalBuilder Server
        url: https://www.finalbuilder.com/finalbuilder-server
        description: |
            FinalBuilder was the company's flagship product and was leading the way in build automation,
            particularly in the Delphi market. Not long after joining the company it was became apparent that 
            our users wanted to have a web-based application in which they could start and monitor their FinalBuilder 
            software builds.

            I was given the opportunity to lead the development of this new product, as we were aiming to make 
            headway into the new .NET ecosystem, and I had the most knowledge. We built the product using .NET/C#,
            using ASP.NET WebForms for UI, and hosted a supervisor process as a Windows service controlling the
            individual build processes.

            I regard this project as one of the great successes of my career so far and often admire what we were
            able to achieve with so few resources. The were able to build a lot of great relationships with
            our customers, and provide them with software they genuinely loved and felt passionate about.

      - name: ContinuaCI
        url: https://www.finalbuilder.com/continua-ci
        description: |
            Continua CI was the replacement for FinalBuilder Server, and was envisioned to be the company's
            solution to a build-tool agnostic and modern continuous integration platform.

            Continuing on from the development of FinalBuilder Server, it was my responsibility to architect,
            design and begin development of our new product. The design split out the components into multiple
            services; web application, build coordinator and build agents. They services communicated with
            each other using WCF, with the coordinator using PostgreSQL as the data store.

            Significant parts of the project which I developed include:

              - Building extension points in the application which enabled the development of plugins. The system 
                used AppDomains to isolate loading of foreign assemblies and allowed plugins to be reloaded.
              - Using .NET attributes to decorate plugin class properties and using these properties to
                generate web controls for editing/viewing in the interface.
              - Build workflow engine. FinalBuilder was known for it's graphical interface and we wanted
                to replicate this kind of visual environment in the browser. I designed the workflow engine and the
                web interface for constructing build workflows.
