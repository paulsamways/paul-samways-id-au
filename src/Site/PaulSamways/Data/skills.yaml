              .NET / C# has been a cornerstone of my career and I've been using and following its development
              since C# 1.1. While there are many other languages which I use, I still enjoy going back to C#.
              Microsoft's recent efforts in making the platform cross-platform and open-source  has been an exciting 
              development, and one which gives me confidence in continuing to invest in the ecosystem.

              TypeScript has been a wonderful and pragmatic approach to improving the language situation
              in client-side web development. I'm a big fan of strongly and statically typed languages,
              and TypeScript continues to impress with how expressive the type system is and how successfully
              types have been retrofitted to a language like JavaScript.

              While I have only had to the opportunity to use Go professionally for one project, it is a
              language I would comfortably say I am proficient in. Its simplicity and tooling makes it quick to
              learn and quickly gets out of the way.

              Haskell was a detour in my professional career to focus on functional programming. Having the
              opportunity to work with some of the top functional programmers while at CSIRO Data61, was an experience 
              that challenged me in many ways. Functors, applicative functors, monads, monad transformers 
              and the rest all became part of my thinking how to compose software, and it really opened
              my eyes to a different way of writing software.

        Having started my career in the mid-2000s, the web has almost always played a role in the projects
        I've been involved with. I have a good understanding of the underlying standards, practices and technologies,
        i.e., HTML, CSS, Browser Web APIs, API design standards and the HTTP protocol, and are able to apply 
        them when using new libraries or frameworks.

                  ASP.NET (Web Forms, MVC, Pages, Web APIs) has been the predominant back-end framework which I've
                  used to build web-based applications and services. The majority of my experience has been with
                  ASP.NET MVC, which was a favourable switch from Web Forms when it was first released.

                  Using ASP.NET's Blazor in a personal project has allowed me to evaluate how well the new framework
                  works for non-trivial applications. I have been pleasantly surprised with how well it works,
                  how far you can get without falling back to JavaScript, and how well it performs overall. I'm eager
                  to see whether it will continue to improve, and lead the way for WASM based client-side web
                  development.

                  React (and similarity, Mithril.js) have been my go-to libraries for writing rich client-side
                  web applications. I've used these libraries to write both single-page applications, and to
                  write client-side components for server-rendered pages.

              PostgreSQL has been utilized in a wide range of projects throughout my career. I'm comfortable
              designing new database schemas/models, writing complex SQL queries, and analysing query execution plans

              Apache Spark (and Apache Hadoop) was the distributed processing framework used to process
              billions of transaction reports at AUSTRAC. My role as an analytics engineer involved maintaining
              complex data processing pipelines and algorithms which has provided me with experience on
              how to work with really big data.

              Linux has always been my preferred operating system. My interest goes all the way back to high school, 
              where I'd spend countless hours tinkering and trying out different distributions. The highlight of this
              was persisting with ([Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)) on my 
              old Pentium 133Mhz which would take about a week to compile the entire system. ðŸ¤“
  
              This passion has become a great benefit with Linux becoming the de-facto operating system used in
              the cloud. It has given me the fundamental knowledge to understand how modern deployment tools like
              containerisation work, and allows me to quickly get up to speed with new tools and techniques.
  
              I frequently utilise automation tools, such as Terraform and Ansible, along with simple bash
              scripts, to make processes repeatable and dependable.
